# AI-Powered Sign Language Translator
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to create a system that enhances communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating sign language into text in real time. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide an effective solution for dynamic action detection and interpretation.

## Why This Project?
This project was built to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-sign language users. By developing a real-time translation system, the project aims to facilitate better understanding and interaction in various social and professional settings.

## Problem Solved
The project addresses the challenge of real-time sign language translation, offering a solution that interprets sign language gestures from video feeds and converts them into text. This helps in making communication more accessible and seamless for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I have learned:

- The intricacies of dynamic action detection using MediaPipe.
- How to implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction.
- The process of developing a real-time system capable of interpreting complex gestures.
- Techniques for evaluating model performance using confusion matrices and accuracy assessments.
- The importance of high reliability and performance in assistive technology applications.
